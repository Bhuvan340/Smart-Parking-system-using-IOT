The Smart Parking System project utilizes IR sensors, the ESP32 microcontroller, and the Blynk IoT application to provide a real-time, automated solution for parking space management. The system detects available parking spots using IR sensors, which sense the presence or absence of a vehicle. This data is then communicated to a central platform via the ESP32, which processes the information and sends updates to users through the Blynk IoT application.

Using Blynk, the parking system's status, including the availability of parking spots, is displayed in real-time on a mobile app, giving users immediate access to parking information. This reduces the time spent searching for parking and enhances user convenience. The integration of IoT technology ensures that the system is efficient, scalable, and ideal for managing parking in busy urban areas, helping to reduce traffic congestion and improve parking management overall.
